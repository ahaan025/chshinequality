this project aims to demostrate the violation of the CHSH inequality on an IBM quantum computer, which provides experimental evidence that quantum mechanics exhibits non-local correlations that cannot be accounted for by any local hidden variable model. This is a fundamental result that distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical physics and local hidden variable theories.

p.s. comments and in-depth explanation will soon be added.
